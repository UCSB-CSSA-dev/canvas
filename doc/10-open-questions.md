# 10 Open Questions

Decisions still to be made. Each has a **current default** that the docs and code assume until someone decides otherwise.

How to use this file:

- Agents: if your task depends on one of these, either ask the user or implement the default and mention that you did.
- When a question is decided, remove it from here, update the relevant doc, and add a line to the "Decided" log at the bottom.

## Permissions and oversight

### Q1. Cross-department DMs

A member of 活动部 DMs a member of 宣传部. Who can read it through oversight?

- **Default:** leads of **both** departments (each oversees their own member) plus presidium. This follows directly from the `oversees` rule.
- Alternative: presidium only for cross-department DMs.

### Q2. Leads' own DMs and group chats

Who can read messages sent by a department lead?

- **Default:** presidium only. Co-leads and other leads cannot.
- Alternative: co-leads of the same department can read each other's content.

### Q3. Should leads approve accounts?

- **Default:** yes, leads can approve applicants who requested their department, as members only. Presidium can approve anyone.
- Alternative: presidium only.

## Content and retention

### Q6. Officer term handover and old data

What happens to messages, files, and assignments when a school year ends?

- **Default:** keep everything. Department channels and folders carry over to the new leads. Graduated members are deactivated, not deleted.
- Alternative: archive each year's channels and start fresh ones, or auto-delete after N years.

## Features

### Q10. Department list

- **Default:** seed 主席团, 活动部, 国际部, 宣传部. Admins add the rest from the roster page.
- Needed: the full, current list of CSSA departments with official English names.

### Q12. Custom domain and account ownership

Hosting is decided (GitHub Pages static export + Convex Cloud, see Decided below).

- **Default:** `https://ucsb-cssa-dev.github.io/canvas/`, Convex free tier.
- Needed: whether CSSA wants a custom domain, and who owns the GitHub organization and Convex team for continuity across officer terms.

## Accounts and roster (added with Stage 1)

### Q14. Do pre-approvals expire?

- **Default:** no. Unclaimed pre-approvals stay active until revoked. The roster shows them so they can be cleaned up.
- Alternative: expire after N days (for example 30), or at the end of the school year.

### Q15. Do pre-approved users still see the oversight notice?

- **Default:** yes. They skip the approval wait but still complete the short onboarding (names + notice checkbox), because consent must come from the person, not the admin who invited them.
- Alternative: skip onboarding entirely and ask for names and consent later. Not recommended.

### Q16. Titles inside the hierarchy

Should the roster show titles such as 主席, 副主席, 秘书长, or only the role (主席团 member, 部长, 部员)?

- **Default:** role only.
- Alternative: an optional free-text `title` on `departmentMemberships`, edited by admins.

### Q17. Is the system admin visible on the roster?

- **Default:** yes, with a small "系统管理员 / Admin" badge wherever they appear. If they are in no department, they show under "未分配部门 / No department".
- Alternative: hide the system admin from members unless they hold a department role.

### Q18. Can leads also approve pending applicants (not just pre-approve)?

- **Default:** yes, same as Q3: leads can approve applicants who requested their department, as members only.
- Alternative: leads can only pre-approve emails; only admins approve pending applicants.
